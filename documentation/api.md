# API

The primary cogs of Lonamic reside in the [core](/api/core.md) functions. Lonamic also provides sensible defaults in the [can](/api/can.md), [filter](/api/filter.md), and [inheritance](/api/inheritance.md) methods, but is designed so that you can easily replace any of the defaults with your own code.

* [core](/api/core.md)
